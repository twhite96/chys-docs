Frustrated by Grammarly and Hemingway apps' inability to process markdown blog posts, I decided to make my own site to process markdown blog posts or other texts. I settled on [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) a [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/index.html) library for the UI because I like colorful things.

# Installation

You'll need to install dev dependencies.


## Development setup

There are a few dependencies and I want to thank [@btford](https://github.com/btford) for his awesome library which without him this wouldn't be as easy.

Fork the repo, and add your own `package.json` file with:

```bash
npm init
```
and fill in all the gritty details.

The site uses Brian Ford's `write-good` linter for native English and GitBook's `hunspell-spellchecker` for the spellchecker I am using.

To install `write-good`:

```bash
npm install write-good
```
...and hunspell:

```bash
npm install hunspell-spellchecker
```

# Usage example

You can basically do what you like with this. I am using MEN stack with Mongo, Express, and Node, using RESTful routes and hosting on Heroku. It is up to you how you want to build on top of what I have here.

## Using the `write-good` library

You need to require it in your `app.js` or whatver you're going to use to route interaction through the app (if you're using MEAN or MEN). Your script could look something like:

```javascript
var writeGood = require('write-good');

const inputs = document.getElementById('texts').getElementsByTagName('textarea');
const input = [];
for (let i = 0, l = inputs.length; i < l; ++i) {
    if (inputs[i].value.length) {
        input.push(inputs[i].value);
    }
}

let suggestions = writeGood(input);

const div = document.createElement('div');
for (let i = 0, l = sugesstions.length; i < l; ++i) {
    div.innerHTML += sugesstions[i] + "<br />";
}
document.body.appendChild(div);
```
